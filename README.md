Project Title: Data Analysis and Visualization with Python

Introduction

This project showcases my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization using Python. The project involves processing datasets, applying statistical methods, and generating insights using visualization techniques. Through Jupyter notebooks, I demonstrate my ability to handle real-world data and extract meaningful conclusions.

Purpose

The goal of this project is to analyze datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), apply statistical modeling techniques, and create visualizations to communicate key findings effectively. By structuring the analysis within Jupyter notebooks, I illustrate my proficiency in Python for data-driven decision-making.
