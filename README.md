# Data Analysis and Visualization with Python: Passengers aboard the Titanic

## Introduction

This project showcases my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization using Python. The project involves:

- Processing datasets
- Applying statistical methods
- Generating insights using visualization techniques

Through Jupyter notebooks, I demonstrate my ability to handle real-world data and extract meaningful conclusions.The project is divided into two files,one for data visualization insights and the second file for applying ML models to our titanic dataset in order to predict survivors.These files are:
- [Data-PreProcessing.ipynb] (Data_PreProcessing.ipynb)
- [Data_Modeling.ipynb] (Data_Modeling.ipynb)

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Analyze datasets
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Apply statistical modeling techniques
- Create visualizations to communicate key findings effectively
- Dataset used for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data, file `train.csv`. 

## Skills Learned

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, transforming datasets, and ensuring data quality
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns, correlations, and insights
- **Statistical Modeling & Hypothesis Testing**: Applying statistical methods to draw conclusions
- **Data Visualization**: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful representations
- **Structured & Well-Documented Code**: Writing clear, reproducible Jupyter notebooks
- **Effective Communication of Insights**: Using Markdown and visuals to convey findings
